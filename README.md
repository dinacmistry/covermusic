This was an independent research project I conducted for PHYS 5116: Complex Networks, a graduate course I took during my PhD at Northeastern University, and taught by Prof. Laszlo Barabasi and Prof. Roberta Sinatra. I'll be adding to the repository overtime, but for now you should be able to find final presentation on the project. 
So what exactly is this project about?

As part of the course, we were tasked with finding a network to study and analyze as a sort of hands on side to our Complex Networks course. Being a musician in a former life, I've spent a lot of time thinking about music and something I've always been good at is recognizing samples in songs, remembering which songs were actually cover versions, or knowing other odd music facts.
